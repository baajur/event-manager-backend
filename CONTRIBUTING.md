## How to contribute to Mikamai Event Manager

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Rails**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](https://rubyonrails.org/security/).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/mikamai/event-manager-backend/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/mikamai/event-manager-backend/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* PRs must pass all quality checks and have been reviewed by at least one maintainer to be approved.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in a [new issue](https://github.com/mikamai/event-manager-backend/issues/new), using the appropriate template, and start writing code.

* Open a PR when you are ready. However we suggest waiting for positive feedback on the issue as it will greatly increase the chances of the change being accepted.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* We're still setting up public communication channels, stay tuned.
